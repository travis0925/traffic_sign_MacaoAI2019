This a tutorial for high school students participating in Macao AI Challenge 2019, which about feature detection and description in images.

You can learn how to implement several algorithms of feature detection and description in images, including: 
1. Feature detection \
   1.1 Point-based detection(Harris corner) \
   1.2 Edge-based detection(Roberts, Prewitt, Sobel and Canny;Hough detection: line and circle) \
   1.3 Region-based detection(Threshold: Otsu's and Niblack;Morphology: erosion, dilation, opening and closing) \
   1.4 Color feature(Channel split and Color histogram) \
   1.5 Texture feature(GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix), Gabor and LBP (Local Binary Pattern)) \
2. Feature description \
   SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)
